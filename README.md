# Microservice Starter

This is a Template for a Microservices Project, based on DDD and Hexagonal Architecture. It is intended to serve
as an example, and as a starting point for a green-field project.

- Design
- Architecture
- Coding standards
- Project organisation
- Build integration

All Gradle plugins are integrated and configured, so the gradle build should work.

The project is not fully fleshed out with modelling, business logic and tests.

See [USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md) for instructions on how to run the microservices.
